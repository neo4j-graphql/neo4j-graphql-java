= Connections Filtering

== Setup

.Schema
[source,graphql,schema=true]
----
type Movie {
  title: String!
  actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}

type Actor {
  name: String!
  movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
}
----

== allows for NOT boolean operators on connection projection filters

.Test Data
[source,cypher,test-data=true]
----
CREATE (movie:Movie {title: "My title"})
					CREATE (actorOne:Actor {name: "Arthur"})
					CREATE (actorTwo:Actor {name: "Zaphod"})
					CREATE (actorOne)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(actorTwo)

        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

.Expected Cypher params
[source,json]
----

.Expected Cypher output
[source,cypher]
