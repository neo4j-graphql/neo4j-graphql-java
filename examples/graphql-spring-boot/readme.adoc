= Example: Integration of Neo4j-GraphQL-Java into a Spring Boot application

== Overview

This example uses the https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/[graphql-kotlin library]

In the link:src/main/kotlin/org/neo4j/graphql/examples/graphqlspringboot/config/Neo4jConfiguration.kt[Neo4jConfiguration]
a DataFetchingInterceptor is created, which will be bound to all the graphql fields generated by the neo4j-graphql-library.
Its purpose is the execution of the cypher query and the transformation of the query result.

In the link:src/main/kotlin/org/neo4j/graphql/examples/graphqlspringboot/config/GraphQLConfiguration.kt[GraphQLConfiguration]
the link:src/main/resources/schema.graphql[schema] to be enhanced by the library is loaded as `neo4jSchema`.
Additionally a `springSchema` is generated which is generated from the methods defined in
link:src/main/kotlin/org/neo4j/graphql/examples/graphqlspringboot/controller/AdditionalQueries.kt[AdditionalQueries].

The `springSchema` and the `neo4jSchema` are merged to a single graphql schema exposed by the app.

== Run the example

1. link:src/main/resources/application.yaml[configue your neo4j db]
2. run the link:src/main/kotlin/org/neo4j/graphql/examples/graphqlspringboot/GraphqlSpringBootApplication.kt[spring boot application]
3. open http://localhost:8080/playground to run some graphql queries
